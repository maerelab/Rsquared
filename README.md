This repository contains all code for running simulations and analyses
for the paper “Out-of-sample $R^2$: estimation and inference” by Stijn
Hawinkel, Willem Waegeman and Steven Maere. The methodology for
calculating out-of-sample $R^2$ and its standard error is available in
the R-package *oosse* on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/oosse/index.html). It can
be installed as:

``` r
install.packages("oosse")
